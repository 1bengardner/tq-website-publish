    <p>We are told to fail fast: oxymoronically, errors exist to aid you in fixing problems. We are told coupling is bad. However, coupling is sometimes good.</p>

<p>I think I encountered a good microcosmic example of the importance of failing fast, <em>good</em> coupling and locality: locality meaning how close things are to where they take effect. <small>Usually it’s in reference to computer memory and its impact on performance.</small> I want to discuss locality as it relates to source code and its impact on readability.</p>

<p>This example is about strings—<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting"><em>%-formatted strings</em></a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Today, I fixed a bug from two years ago.</p>

<p>While playing, my friend Kyle stumbled upon a funny piece of in-game text:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python2">"Hey! Are you %s? %s from %s's Quest?!"
</code></pre>

<p>The game carried on like normal, but that piece gave us a laugh.</p>

<p>A quick and easy fix: just add the missing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">% (character.name)</code> bit.</p>

<p>…<small>Ok, in this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">% ((character.name,) * 3)</code></small></p>

<p>However, the repercussions are worrisome:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This pattern is used extensively throughout the codebase. <em>How many more times does this bug appear?</em></li>
  <li>This could potentially be more harmful. The program continued in this case. <em>If I remembered the %, but supplied the incorrect number of values, I would get a TypeError and execution would stop!</em></li>
</ol>

<p>❦</p>

<p>What caused this to happen?</p>

<p>By using <em>%-strings</em>, I am prone to these mistakes because the compiler permits them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forgetting the %-values</li>
  <li>Including the wrong number of %-values</li>
</ul>

<p>That means I get runtime errors instead.</p>

<p>In my situation, if the program had simply failed instead when it noticed the missing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">% (arguments)</code>, I would have fixed my issue and not have to worry. I don’t believe it has the power to do that though, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s</code> is dual-purposed as a percent sign, contingent on the omission of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">% (arguments)</code>, as I had mistakenly committed.</p>

<p>Now <em>%-strings</em> are a good choice for coding in a small, manageable capacity, but Toshe’s Quest II has a lot of lines of code.</p>

<p>❦</p>

<p>How can I do better?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0498"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f-strings</code></a>.</p>

<p><em>f-strings</em> are great because they localize the formatted string values. Instead of the string template and values being side-by-side, the values become embedded within the template:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python2">f"Hey! Are you {character.name}? {character.name} from Toshe's Quest?!"
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>f-string</em> is easier to read, which in general reduces bugs. It also <em>completely eliminates</em> the bug scenarios I mentioned! By coupling template and values, to forget or miscount values would mean a malformed template. That would be much easier to spot.</p>

<p>The caveat is that this feature did not become available until Python 3. I can see now that I had to make do with what was available, given my choice to continue using Python 2. What a wild time that was! The next question to ponder might be <em>would it have been worth it to migrate to Python 3, and at which point during development would that have been?</em></p>
